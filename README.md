# purescript-pux-redux

Types and helper functions for building pux apps that interact with
an external redux store

This library is intended to ease the adoption of Purescript into existing
react+redux code bases. If you are starting from scratch, there's no good reason
to use redux. Do your state management with pux instead.

## Usage

See [here](https://gitlab.com/schalmers/purescript-in-javascript/tree/master/webpack-react-pux#how-to-interact-with-a-redux-store-from-a-pux-component)
for a usage guide.
